## 100 - Introduction

What is CARTO?

CARTO is an open, powerful, and intuitive platform for discovering and predicting the key insights underlying the location data in our world.

Empower organizations to optimize operational performance, strategic investments, and everyday decisions with CARTO Engine—our embeddable platform for web and mobile apps—and the new CARTO Builder, a drag and drop analysis tool.

It was built to make it easier for people to tell their stories by providing them with flexible and intuitive ways to create maps and design geospatial applications. CARTO can be installed on your own server and we also offer a hosted service at [carto.com](https://carto.com/).
